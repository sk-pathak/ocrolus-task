## Features
- CRUD operations for articles
- User authentication using JWT
- Track & retrieve recently viewed articles per user
- Rate limiter
- Fully dockerized
- Database Migrations

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.20+
- Postgresql
- Make

- goose
- docker & docker compose

**Make sure both `.env` file and `.secrets` file is present in the root directory. An example for each of these files is included**

### Local Development
Please ensure the prerequisites are installed in the system

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sk-pathak/ocrolus-task.git

| POST   | `/login`                                             | Authenticate user            |
| GET    | `/users`                                             | List all users               |
| GET    | `/users/:id`                                         | Get user by id               |
| GET    | `/users/me/recent-views`                             | List recently viewed         |
| GET    | `/users/me/articles?limit={limit}&offset={offset}`   | List my articles             |
| GET    | `/articles?limit={limit}&offset={offset}`            | List all articles            |
| POST   | `/articles`                                          | Create an article            |
| GET    | `/articles/:id`                                      | View single article          |

All endpoints except for `/articles`, `/register` and `/login` are protected by JWT authentication. Make sure to register & log in user before making other calls to API. Both `/articles` and `/users/me/articles` are paginated

## Next Steps

- Refresh Tokens for JWT (*more secure*)
- Role Based Access Control (*finer control*)
- Unit Tests
